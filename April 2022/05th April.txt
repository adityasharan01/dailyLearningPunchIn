11. Container With Most Water

ch step  area = length * max_width 
 
 we need to have two pointers 
 and calculate the maximum area by moving the pointers at each step 


class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int l=0;
        int h=height.length-1;
        int area=0;
        while(l<h){
            area=Math.max(area,Math.min(height[h],height[l])*(h-l));
            if(height[l]<height[h])
                l++;
            else
                h--;
        }
        return area;
    }
}
